# Schematic review checklist

Is the design passively or actively safe? For example, if an MCU or
FPGA is being programmed, held in reset, or in their POR, does the
circuit enter a safe / idle / known state? Is the circuit only “hot”
under control (can it be)?

Can all relevant environmental changes be detected? If changes in
environment indicate a change in operating state or mode, can they be
detected? Examples: VBUS high on a self-powered USB device, SD card in
socket, a particular connector plugged in, water ingress, etc.
